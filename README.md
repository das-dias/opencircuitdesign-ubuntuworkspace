# Ubuntu Workspace Setup Script

This repo features a shell script that automatically installs every application and tool that implements an Open Circuit Design workspace. Other tools like Spotify, Discord and Slack are also installed because I find them essential in every workspace =) !

## Usage
Clone the repo, change into its directory and simply run the script! Simple as that!

```
git clone https://github.com/das-dias/opencircuitdesign-ubuntuworkspace.git
cd opencircuitdesign-ubuntuworkspace
sh buildws.sh
```
